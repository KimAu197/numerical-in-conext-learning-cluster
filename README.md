# Numerical In-Context Learning for Clustering with Linear Transformers

This repository contains code developed for my undergraduate thesis on **in-context learning with linear Transformers** applied to **numerical clustering tasks**.  

## üìÇ Repository Structure

### `src/`
- **train.py** ‚Äì training entry point  
- **eval_cluster.py** ‚Äì evaluation of clustering tasks  
- **conf/** ‚Äì YAML configs for models and tasks  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Create the conda environment from `environment.yml`:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate num-cluster
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Training

Run training on clustering tasks:

```bash
python src/train.py --config src/conf/cluster_2d.yaml # change xd for different dimention
```

2. Evaluation

Evaluate a trained model:

```bash
python src/eval_cluster.py --config src/conf/cluster_2d_eval.yaml
```


## üìä Results
	‚Ä¢	Models perform well at template matching (memorizing cluster examples seen in context).
	‚Ä¢	Generalization to new clustering rules or shapes is limited.
	‚Ä¢	Behavior suggests linear Transformers act more like memory-based pattern matchers rather than learners of universal clustering functions.

The 2 figures show the decision boundary diagrams of models trained at 0 steps, 30,000 steps, 250,000 steps, and 500,000 steps on four types of distributed data:
